# owwc-bra-matchgen
CLI based match generator and player pool manager made for and used in the Team Brazil Overwatch World Cup 2023 tryouts.

Personal project made both as a learning experience and to facilitate my role as a coach for the national brazilian team in the OWWC 2023.

Can generate matches based on a simple manually set elo system; list, remove and add players to pool; while saving it all to a .csv formatted (player name, role, elo, matches played) file for continuous use.
